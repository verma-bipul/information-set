Uncertainty principle is like the single canonball destroying the whole fortress of determinism. In very simple terms this principle says that the more precisely we know the momentum of a particle the less precisely we know its exact position and vice-versa. The underlying priciple at work here is the fact that mere act of observing, being itself a physical phenomenon alters the physical state of what is being observed. For instance, photon detector is used to observe an electron, the photon will impart energy to the electron and change the state of the electron from when it was originally observed.
