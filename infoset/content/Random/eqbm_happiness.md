Suppose that agents are happy when they think that other agents think nice of them and are sad otherwise. But there is no way to know what other agents actually think of them. There are highly imperfect signals from which the agent infers what others think. In this scenario it may be optimal to think that other agents always think nice of them and ignore any signals all together.
