*Things differ among people because people are different but people are different because things are different.*   

The underlying idea here is that heterogeniety can be self reinforcing. Why is there heterogeniry in the first place? Because there is heterogeniety some place elsewhere, giving rise to this heterogeniety. Following this chain of logic, heterogeniety has to be circular i.e either there is heterogenity at all places or there is no heterogeniety at all.
