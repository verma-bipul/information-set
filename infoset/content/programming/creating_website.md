I was long looking for a hugo theme where I could organize my content in a tree directory structure. I finally found the one that I am currently using.  
The theme is named *the-roots-home*. The link to its gihub repo is https://github.com/rmsubekti/the-roots-home

In order to learn how to actually publish contents, I used the tutorial here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIFvgrRxdt4

To compile and view the site locally run
```hugo
hugo server
```

### Publishing Contents

Once content has been added its time to public them on the internet.  

### Website Organization

I like the tree organization of the website. I have subdirectories created under the content/ directory to organize my contents.    
Note: In order to list all the directories, subdirectories, and posts exactly as in the content directory, it is necessary to have the \_index.md file in each of the subdirectories.
